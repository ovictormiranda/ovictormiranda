Hey there 
I'm Victor Miranda. Currently I'm a System Analyst at Itaguaí Construções Navais, the only company in the southern hemisphere to build Submarines. Working with JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQLServer, git, Portainer, Jenkins, Docker and more...
I'm graduated in System Analysis and Development, postgraduating in Software Engineering.
I also love Artificial Intelligence. I like to play the Iron Man, using Python to do some cool things with Computer Vision. I like to see those things happen.
I have also worked with Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence and others.
The only certainty I have is that learning is an endless road and I want to stay on it. So I love technology and applying knowledge to solve problems, creating solutions and impacting lives.
